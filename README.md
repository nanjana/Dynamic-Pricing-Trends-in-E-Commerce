# Dynamic-Pricing-Trends-in-E-Commerce

This repository showcases a comprehensive project focused on building, optimizing, and analyzing a data warehouse using PostgreSQL and Tableau. The project integrates datasets from Kaggle and eBay, implementing advanced data processing techniques and delivering dynamic insights through a Tableau dashboard.

Project Workflow
1. Datasets
Sourced datasets from Kaggle and web-scraped data from eBay.
Focused on three product categories: tablets, smartphones, and headphones.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed EDA in Python to clean, preprocess, and understand the datasets.

3. Staging Tables
Imported datasets into PostgreSQL staging tables to organize raw data for further processing.

4. Joins, Subqueries, and OLAP Functions
Utilized SQL techniques like joins, subqueries, RANK, and OLAP functions to derive meaningful insights.

5. Data Warehouse: Star Schema
Designed a star schema to structure data for efficient querying and analysis.

6. Materialized Views and Summary Tables
Created materialized views and summary tables to optimize complex aggregations and enhance query performance.

7. Dynamic Pricing Model
Built a dynamic pricing model leveraging the processed data to analyze pricing trends.

8. Stored Procedures
Implemented stored procedures to automate repetitive tasks and streamline data operations.

9. Performance Tuning
Performed indexing, partitioning, and query optimizations to improve performance and reduce execution times.

10. Integration with Tableau
Connected PostgreSQL to Tableau (live connection) to enable real-time data visualization.

11. Tableau Dashboard
Designed a dynamic dashboard in Tableau to visualize key metrics, trends, and insights.
Developed a Tableau data pipeline to streamline the flow of data for visualizations.

Key Features
 1.  Efficient Data Pipeline: Seamlessly processes raw data into actionable insights.
 2.  Optimized Performance: Implements advanced SQL and PostgreSQL techniques for fast query execution.
 3.  Interactive Visualizations: Real-time dashboards in Tableau for exploring trends and decision-making.
